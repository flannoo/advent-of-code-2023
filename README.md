# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2023), using a .NET 8 console application.

I created a seperate class for each challenge and use the program.cs to execute the challenges which shows the output result in a console window.

The input files are not included, since they are copyright protected.
Create a folder named "adventofcode2023" that includes the input files with the name "Mission{day}.txt" (ex. "Mission1.txt) or change the file reference in the program.cs file.

The input files for each challenge can be found on the [Advent of Code 2023 website](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
